# Calculators
This is a repository containing little calculator programs that I enjoy making. I just find them fun to create. I find often in an academic setting you do not get to just code little fun programs. I enjoy math, and I enjoy implementing it into programming. One thing I wish I got to experience during my time as an undergraduate CSE student, was using more math when making programs. Math is beautiful and it can do so much for us.

# Compile Instructions
These programs were compiled and run on an Oracle VM Virtual Box (Linux Ubuntu (64-bit). If you do not have access to a Linux operating system, you can probably find an online compiler to run these programs. I will leave that up to you. And I expect you to have some knowldge of how to use the terminal to do things such as cd Desktop or other basic commands. I also expect you to have enough background to be able to obtain the source code from this repo as you would like. If you do not know how to use a terminal or how to obtain the source code from this repo, that is no problem, there is an entire internet that is free to learn from!

# For Programs Written in C
1. Download or copy the desired source code
2. When the source code is successfully downloaded, place it into a directory of your choice
3. Compile the program in the terminal while in the directory containing the source code:
   1. gcc -std=c99 -o car_gas_calculator car_gas_calculator.c
4. Once the source code is succesffuly compiled, run the executable in the terminal
   1. ./car_gas_calculator
5. Once the exceutable is entered, the program should run

# Known Issues
Currently there are no known issues because the programs are very simple. If bugs or issues are encounted, please let me know and I will list them here and if they are fixed I will remove the issue from this list.
